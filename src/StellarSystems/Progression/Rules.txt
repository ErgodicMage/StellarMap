System consists of one or more stars, planets and other bodies.
Cluster is a group of one or more connected Systems.
Sector is a group of one or more Cluster.
Region is a group of one or more Sectors.
District is a group of one or more Regions.
Zone is a group of one or more Districts.
Sphere is a group of one or more Zones.
Quadrant is a group of one or more Spheres.
Galaxy is a group of multiple Quadrants.

A Bridge is a traversable space-time wormhole which connects different star systems. There are four types of bridges:
System Bridges connect one or more star systems together into a Cluster.
Cluster Bridges connect one or more Clusters together into a Sector.
Sector Bridges connect one or more Sectors together into a Region.
Region Bridges connect one or more Regions into a District.
District Bridges connect one or more Districts together into a Zone.
Zone Bridges connect one or more Zones together into a Sphere.
Sphere Bridges connect one or more Spheres together into a Quadrant.
Quadrant Bridges connect one or more Quadrants into a Galaxy.


Bridges are entered and exited through gravitational anomalies known as Portals. Activating a Designator requires a specific amount of energy depending on the Bridge type.
Optional: The distances between stars that a bridge passes can be limited depending on the type. For Example System Bridges less that 15ly;

Overall Rule:
	Every System has at least one Bridge.
	There must be least one path between any two Systems.

System Rules:
	Every System must have at least one Star.	
	Every System must have at least one System Bridge Portal, unless there no other Systems in the Cluster.
	If there are no other Systems in the Cluster then it must have either a Cluster or Sector Portal.

Cluster Rules:
	Every Cluster must have at least one System.
	Every Cluster must have at least one Cluster Portal, unless there are no other Clusters in the Sector.
	If there are no other Clusters in the Sector then it must have a Sector Portal.

Sector Rules:
	Every Sector must have at least one Cluster.
	Every Sector must have at least one Sector Portal, unless there are no other Sectors in the Region.

Region Rules:
	Every Region must have at least one Sector.
	Every Region must have at least one Region Portal, unless there are no other Regions in the District.

District Rules:
	Every District must have at least one Region.
	Every District must have at least one District Portal, unless there are no other Districts in the Zone.

Zone Rules:
	Every Zones must have at least one District.
	Every Zone must have at least one Zone Portal, unless there are no other Zones in the Sphere

Sphere Rules:
	Every Sphere must have at least one Zone.
	Every Sphere must have at least one Sphere Portal, unless there are no other Spheres in the Region..

Quadrant Rules:
	Every Quadrant must have at least one Regions.
	Every Quadrant must have at least one Quadrant Portal, unless there are no other Quadrants in the Galaxy.
