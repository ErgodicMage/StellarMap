# Progression Rules

## Connected Bodies
1. System consists of one or more stars, planets and other bodies.
2. Cluster is a group of one or more connected Systems.
3. Sector is a group of one or more Cluster.
4. Region is a group of one or more Sectors.
5. District is a group of one or more Regions.
6. Zone is a group of one or more Districts.
7. Sphere is a group of one or more Zones.
8. Quadrant is a group of one or more Spheres.
8. Galaxy is a group of multiple Quadrants.

## Bridges
A Bridge is a traversable space-time wormhole which connects different star systems. Bridges are entered and exited through gravitational anomalies known as Portals. Activating a Bridge requires a specific amount of energy depending on the Bridge type.

There are four types of bridges:
1. System Bridges connect one or more star systems together into a Cluster.
2. Cluster Bridges connect one or more Clusters together into a Sector.
3. Sector Bridges connect one or more Sectors together into a Region.
4. Region Bridges connect one or more Regions into a District.
5. District Bridges connect one or more Districts together into a Zone.
6. Zone Bridges connect one or more Zones together into a Sphere.
7. Sphere Bridges connect one or more Spheres together into a Quadrant.
8. Quadrant Bridges connect one or more Quadrants into a Galaxy.

#### Optional: 
The distances between stars that a bridge passes can be limited depending on the type. For Example System Bridges less that 15ly;
